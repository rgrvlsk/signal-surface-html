# Migration Map

## Runtime Resolution

Before reading contracts or running scripts, choose compiler access:

1. If `../../surface-kit/scripts/render-surface.mjs` exists relative to this skill, use the bundled full-plugin commands:
   - `node ../../surface-kit/scripts/create-surface-project.mjs <spec.json>`
   - `node ../../surface-kit/scripts/render-surface.mjs <project>`
   - `node ../../surface-kit/scripts/import-feedback.mjs <project> <feedback.txt|json>` when importing reviewer feedback.
   - Read `../../surface-kit/references/contracts.md` before creating a spec.
2. If the bundled scripts are missing, assume a standalone skills.sh or copied-skill installation. Use the agent-agnostic package CLI instead:
   - `npx --yes surface-signal-html@latest contract`
   - `npx --yes surface-signal-html@latest create <spec.json>`
   - `npx --yes surface-signal-html@latest render <project>`
   - `npx --yes surface-signal-html@latest import-feedback <project> <feedback.txt|json>` when importing reviewer feedback.
3. If the npm package is not available yet and the GitHub repo is reachable, use the GitHub package spec with the same subcommands: `npx --yes github:rgrvlsk/signal-surface-html <command> ...`.
4. If neither the bundled scripts nor package CLI are available, stop with this notice exactly:

## **Surface Signal HTML runtime unavailable.** Install the full plugin from https://github.com/rgrvlsk/signal-surface-html or install/run the `surface-signal-html` CLI, then retry this skill. This skill cannot generate source-backed HTML without the compiler runtime.

Do not fall back to hand-built HTML.

Create a migration planning surface with phases, gates, blast radius, compatibility, and rollback choices.

## Workflow

1. Read the resolved Surface Signal contract.
2. Build a spec with `artifactType: "migration-map"`.
3. Organize phases by preparation, shadowing, cutover, validation, cleanup, and rollback.
4. Include data contracts, compatibility constraints, monitoring, ownership, and acceptance gates.
5. Enable editing, reorder, comments, and decisions.
6. Create and render through the resolved Surface Signal runtime commands.

## Content Rules

- Make rollback concrete enough to execute.
- Surface compatibility decisions before implementation details.
- Export should state the approved sequence and the gates that stop progression.
